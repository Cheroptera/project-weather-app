# Weather App
Weather app built by Carol Pinzon and Frida Munther Gustavson. 
The assignment was to build a weather app using a public Api according to design specs given by Technigo. 

## The problem
We started off by making the HTML foundation together and made sure that the API worked and that we were good to go. When that was done, we worked in 2 separate branches to divide the js requirements.

We did a feature freeze and made sure we had time for fixing problems when merging. There were quite a few conflicts to solve, so we soon realised that if we were to finish within the next year we should probably change strategy for the remaining part. 
Therefore, we decided to make the styling of the css by mob programming.
